Umake
======

GNU Make based simple automation build system.

Requirements
------------

Makefile was tested with:
 - GNU make (3.81)
 - GCC (4.5.2)
 - findutils (4.4.2)
 - bash (4.2.006)
 - coreutils (8.10)
 - pkg-config (0.25)
 - Linux (2.6.37.3)

There was not used any version specific features, so I think it will
work with older and newer versions of these software.

Installation
------------

Just copy Makefile and 'umake' folder to project's toplevel folder.

Usage
-----

Main syntax:
    make [project] [action] [variables]

Any file with '.prj' extension is treated as configuration (project)
file. Project name is configuration file name without extension.
'depends.prg' is project group file which describe dependencies
between several projects in format (project names without '.prj'):
    dependent_project1 [dep_pr2 ... n]: main_project


Supported actions:
  - all      : build all available targets
  - config   : create new configuration template
  - exec     : execute target
  - clean
    distclean: cleanup project

Variables description:
SRCDIRLIST  - ALL supported sources from these folders will be
              compiled.
SRCLIST     - Source files list to be compiled together with ALL
              files from SOURCEDIRS. If SOURCEDIRS and SOURCES are
              empty then Umake will try to compile all supported sources
              from current folder.
BUILDROOT   - Toplevel output folder (default: current folder).
BINDIR      - Where to put target under BUILDROOT? (default: BUILDROOT/).
TARGET      - Target name (default: configuration file's name w/o
              extension).
TERMNAME    - terminal name for exec action.
TERMOPTIONS - terminal arguments.
CPPFLAGS    - C/C++ preprocessor flags.
CPPMACROS   - C/C++ preprocessor macros definitions.
CPPINCPATH  - C/C++ preprocessor include files path.
CFLAGS      - C compiler flags.
CXXFLAGS    - C++ compiler flags.
LDFLAGS     - Linker flags.
LIBRARYPATH - Libraries search path.
LIBRARIES   - Required libraries list.
REQUIREPKGS - Required 'pkg-config' packages list. Format:
              pkgname[:==|<=|>=version], example:
              REQUIREPKGS = libxine:>=1.1.15 xorg-server

Umake will place intermediate files to:
BUILDROOT/.obj/PROJECT/    - object files
BUILDROOT/.dep/PROJECT/    - dependency files
